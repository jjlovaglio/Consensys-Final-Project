#### Explain in a very simple way what you'd like your project to do. 

#### Walk through a single workflow for the future user of your project.

#### Voting Contract Example Workflow

1. Users will have to register themselves somehow on the contract

2. They have to identify which campaign their voting on

3. They'll have to submit a vote for that campaign.

4. They can't vote twice for a single campaign 

2. Upload it to Github Once you have a general sense of your project (Remember: it should be very simple and not complicated!), we'd like you to setup a Github repository for your project and submit your project idea in the repository's README.md file.
