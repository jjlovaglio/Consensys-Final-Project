Vines NFT's

This are   nft's in that will encode a precise geolocation where a real grapevine is growing.

When you purchase this NFT, the upkeep cost of the real thing is covered for life.

The average yield of a grapevine is around 1kg of grapes, which makes a bottle of wine.

The owner of the NFT can have rights to the produce of that vine every year.

The project consists of a Dapp showing a metaverse version of a given vineyard, showing the status of the asset for current owners.
