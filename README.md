## Final Project

### Project Idea

### Wine Bottles Futures Marketplace

### Introduction
The wine industry is experiencing rapid centralization. Mainly in countries where small business have limited access to loans through banks. As a consequence, small producers are forced to sell their grapes every year to large businesses that don't focus on maximizing the quality potential that those grapes have, but focus on making an average product that is cost efficient at the expense of producers.

### The promise of an improved economic system
The idea is to create a marketplace where producers can give information about the location of their vineyard, and the grapes that they produce and the wines that they could produce if they had proper funding. 

The marketplace would allow producers to tokenize their harvest into bottled wines. One bottle, one token. The producers would be allowed to tokenize, once they show proof that they have harvested the grapes.

Producers would be able to commit directly with wine aficionados that are interested in what they have to offer, being able to fund their operations directly with their clients.


### Project Example Workflow
1. Wine Producer registers on the contract
2. Wine Producer declares a wine to be tokenized (varietal, type, vintage, vineyard location)
3. Wine Producer also declares when the wine will be ready.
4. Wine Producer proves existence of grapes (via picture taken to harvested batch) and uploads it to ipfs. Metadata embedded in token.
5. Wine producer announces his wine tokens available for sale in marketplace
6. Once the ready date has passed, token owners can exchange their tokens with the producer for the real product.
7. Producer burns received token.
