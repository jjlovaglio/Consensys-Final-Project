# Final Project Brainstorming 

#### Idea #1
#### After learning what you've learned so far, do you have any ideas for what you'd like your final project to be? 

I live in Mendoza, Argentina. Where the main driver of the economy is the wine industry. 

Nowadays, small grape producers are struggling to make ends meet
because they are forced to sell their produce to large wineries
that underpay them because the wine they sell is aimed towards 
the mass market.

It takes around 2 years from the moment a producer harvests to having a
ready to sell product. These producers struggle because there is no source of 
funding available for their operations through the traditional banking system.

They have to rely on government subsidies. These subsidies are scarce, politically
appointed, and don't incentivize the producer to craft towards a quality product.

This project aims to create a **marketplace** where any producer, after proper 
validation can **tokenize** their grapes into wine bottle tokens. 

By doing this, every producer can now sell wine futures, financing their operation 
upfront. Creating their own community of supporters and cutting their ties to 
large companies and government subsidies.


At the moment the producer harvests, they know how much wine they can 
produce. Then, they can declare on their profile how
many tokens to issue, representing the batch of that particular harvest.

The producer can update the status of the wine on the metadata of the token, to keep
purchasers updated on how the process is going.

#### Idea #2
#### What's something that you've been thinking about building a blockchain application for?

Vines NFT's

- This are very special nft's in that they will encode a precise geolocation where a real grapevine is growing.
- When you purchase this NFT, its upkeep cost of the real thing is covered for life.
- The average yield of a grapevine is around 1kg of grapes, which makes a bottle of wine.
    -   The owner of the NFT can have rights to  the produce of that vine every year.

- A Dapp showing a metaverse version of a given vineyard, showing the status of the asset for current owners and potential buyers.
